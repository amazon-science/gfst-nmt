## Code

### Setup

`./setup.sh`

### Source Filtering

Source filtering takes an input monolingual corpus and outputs gender-specific sentences into separate files. 
* Current supported languages: English
* Current supported genders: feminine, masculine

`python src/source_filter.py --input INPUT`

### Target Filtering

Target filtering takes an input parallel corpus and uses morphological filtering on the target side to ensure sentences 
contain only the specified gender. 
* Current supported languages: French (fr), German (de), Hebrew (he), Italian (it), Russian (ru)
* Current supported genders: feminine (fem), masculine (msc)

```
python src/target_filter.py \
    --source-input SOURCE_INPUT \
    --target-input TARGET_INPUT \
    --target-language {fr,it,de,he,ru} \
    --gender {msc,fem}
```
